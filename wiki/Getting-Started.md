## First Launch

When you first open Mindwtr, you'll see the **Inbox** view. This is your capture zone.

### The Basic Workflow

1. **Capture** everything to the Inbox
2. **Clarify** each item using the processing wizard
3. **Organize** into Next Actions, Projects, or Someday/Maybe
4. **Reflect** during your Weekly Review
5. **Engage** with confidence

## Quick Add Syntax

Mindwtr supports natural language quick-add. Type directly in the task input:

| Syntax             | Example                    | Result                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `@context`         | `Buy milk @errands`        | Adds @errands context |
| `#tag`             | `Research topic #creative` | Adds #creative tag    |
| `+Project`         | `Call vendor +HomeReno`    | Assigns to project    |
| `+Multi Word`      | `+New Project Name`        | Assigns to "New Project Name" |
| `!Area`            | `Plan roadmap !Work`       | Assigns to area       |
| `/area:<name>`     | `/area:Personal`           | Assigns to area (no spaces) |
| `/start:date`      | `Task /start:monday`       | Sets start date       |
| `/due:date`        | `Report /due:friday`       | Sets due date         |
| `/review:date`     | `Task /review:next week`   | Sets review date      |
| `/note:text`       | `Task /note:remember X`    | Adds description      |
| `/status`          | `/next`, `/waiting`, `/someday`, `/done`, `/archived`, `/inbox` | Sets status |

**Date examples:**
- `/due:today`, `/due:tomorrow`
- `/due:friday`, `/due:next week`
- `/due:in 3 days`, `/due:2025-01-15`
- `/start:tomorrow`, `/review:next week`

Absolute dates use fixed ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD` (for example, `/due:2026-03-15`), regardless of your UI locale/date display format.

**Escaping**
- Use a backslash to keep symbols as plain text: `\\@`, `\\#`, `\\+`, `\\/`
- Example: `Call \\@support /due:tomorrow` → title becomes `Call @support`

**Unicode support**
- Context and tag names accept Unicode letters and numbers (e.g., CJK and accented characters).

> **Tip:** You can also use **Audio Capture** to speak your tasks. Enable it in **Settings → AI Assistant** to use voice-to-text with smart parsing.

## Organizing Model

Mindwtr uses four different grouping tools. Use each for what it is good at:

- **Projects**: Multi-step outcomes you want to complete (for example, "Launch v2 website").
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibility domains with no finish line (for example, "Health", "Family", "Career").
- **Contexts**: Where/how a task can be done (for example, `@home`, `@phone`, `@errands`).
- **Tags**: Flexible labels for energy, theme, or custom grouping (for example, `#focused`, `#lowenergy`).

Practical rule:
- If it has an end state, use a **Project**.
- If it is a long-term life/work domain, use an **Area**.
- If it depends on place/tool/person, use a **Context**.
- If you want optional filtering, use a **Tag**.
