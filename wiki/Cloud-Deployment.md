# Cloud Deployment

This page covers how to run the `apps/cloud` server reliably in production-like self-hosted environments.

## Scope

- Mindwtr Cloud is a lightweight self-hosted backend for JSON sync and token-authenticated task automation endpoints, not a full hosted app UI.
- It is best for single-tenant or small trusted deployments.
- You should run it behind HTTPS reverse proxying and standard server hardening controls.

Client compatibility note:

- Mindwtr Cloud clients require **HTTPS** for public URLs.
- HTTP is accepted only for local/private targets such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` through `172.31.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`, loopback/private IPv6 addresses, `*.local`, and `*.home.arpa`.
- For custom DNS, VPN, Tailscale, ZeroTier, or other names that are not recognized as local/private, add TLS at the reverse proxy layer.
- The **Allow insecure connections (HTTP)** setting is for trusted local/private endpoints only; it is not a public HTTP override.

## Deployment Topology

Recommended layout:

1. Reverse proxy (`nginx`, `caddy`, `traefik`) terminates TLS.
2. Cloud server container/process listens on private interface.
3. Persistent volume stores `MINDWTR_CLOUD_DATA_DIR`.
4. Regular backups snapshot the data directory.

The same cloud service handles both:

- Sync traffic under `/v1/data`
- Task automation endpoints such as `/v1/tasks`, `/v1/projects`, `/v1/areas`, `/v1/sections`, and `/v1/search`

`PUT /v1/data` is merge-based, not a blind replacement. The server reads the current namespace snapshot, merges it with the uploaded snapshot using Mindwtr's normal revision-aware sync rules, validates the merged data, and then writes it back. A client that uploads an older or partial view should not expect to erase newer remote records simply by sending a full JSON payload.

REST reference fields must point to live records. For example, creating or patching a project with an `areaId` whose area was soft-deleted returns `404 Area not found` rather than attaching the project to a tombstone. Use `areaId: null` to clear a project area; an empty string is rejected.

For endpoint-level request and response details, see [[Cloud API]].

## Environment Baseline

Minimum production baseline:

- `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS` set to one or more strong tokens.
- `MINDWTR_CLOUD_CORS_ORIGIN` set to your exact client origin.
- `MINDWTR_CLOUD_DATA_DIR` mounted to persistent storage.
- `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_BODY_BYTES` and `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` tuned for your usage.

Optional but useful:

- `MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_WINDOW_MS`
- `MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_MAX`
- `MINDWTR_CLOUD_ATTACHMENT_RATE_MAX`

## Environment Variables

### Authentication

| Variable | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS` | Comma-separated allowlist of bearer tokens. | Recommended setting for production. |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS_FILE` | Path to a file containing bearer tokens. | Useful for Docker secrets; file contents may match `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS`. |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_TOKEN` | Legacy single-token alias. | Still supported for backward compatibility, but deprecated. |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_TOKEN_FILE` | Path to a file containing the legacy single token. | Still supported for backward compatibility, but deprecated. |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_ALLOW_ANY_TOKEN` | Allows any syntactically valid bearer token. | Explicit opt-in only. Best avoided outside controlled environments. |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_ANY_TOKEN_MAX_NAMESPACES` | Maximum number of distinct namespaces that may be created when any-token mode is enabled. | Defaults to `32`; set only for controlled automation environments. |

### Networking and storage

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_CORS_ORIGIN` | Allowed browser origin for CORS. | `http://localhost:5173` in non-production |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_DATA_DIR` | Directory for JSON namespaces, attachments, and locks. | `./data` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | Trust `X-Forwarded-For`/proxy IP headers for auth-failure rate limiting. | `false` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` | Comma-separated proxy IP allowlist used when proxy headers are trusted. | Empty; forwarded IPs are ignored unless the direct peer is trusted. |

### Request limits

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | Max JSON request size. | `2000000` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` | Max attachment upload size. | `50000000` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-request timeout for cloud handlers. | `30000` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_TASK_TITLE_LENGTH` | Max task title length accepted by cloud task endpoints. | `500` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_TASK_QUICK_ADD_LENGTH` | Max quick-add input length accepted by cloud task creation. | `2000` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_ITEMS_PER_COLLECTION` | Max tasks/projects/sections/areas per uploaded collection. | `50000` |

### Pagination and list shaping

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_LIST_DEFAULT_LIMIT` | Default page size for list endpoints. | `200` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_LIST_MAX_LIMIT` | Hard cap for list endpoint page size. | `1000` |

### Rate limiting

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | Main rate-limit window length. | `60000` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_MAX` | Max non-attachment requests per window. | `120` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_ATTACHMENT_RATE_MAX` | Max attachment requests per window. | same as `MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_MAX` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_CLEANUP_MS` | Interval for pruning expired in-memory rate-limit entries. | `60000` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_MAX_KEYS` | Max distinct in-memory rate-limit keys to keep before LRU-style eviction. | `10000` |
| `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_FAILURE_RATE_MAX` | Max unauthorized attempts per client IP/window before throttling. | `30` |

Operational guidance:

- Keep proxy body limits aligned with `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_BODY_BYTES` and `MINDWTR_CLOUD_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`.
- Leave `MINDWTR_CLOUD_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false` unless the server is only reachable through your reverse proxy. If you enable it, set `MINDWTR_CLOUD_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` to the proxy addresses that are allowed to supply forwarded client IPs.
- If you rotate from `MINDWTR_CLOUD_TOKEN` to `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS`, remember that token changes also change the namespace key.
- Avoid `MINDWTR_CLOUD_ALLOW_ANY_TOKEN=true` for public deployments. It is capped by `MINDWTR_CLOUD_ANY_TOKEN_MAX_NAMESPACES`, but fixed token allowlists are still the production model.

## Docker Runbook

Start with [[Docker Deployment]] for the supported Compose entry points. This section is the operations checklist for running the same cloud container in production-like environments.

For a local HTTP-only smoke test, use `docker/compose.yaml`.

For public desktop or mobile client URLs, use the HTTPS stack:

```bash
cp docker/.env.https.example docker/.env.https.local
```

Edit `docker/.env.https.local`:

```dotenv
MINDWTR_CLOUD_DOMAIN=mindwtr.example.com
MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS=your_long_random_token
MINDWTR_CLOUD_CORS_ORIGIN=https://mindwtr.example.com
MINDWTR_CADDYFILE=Caddyfile.https
```

Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose --env-file docker/.env.https.local -f docker/compose.https.yaml up -d
```

Set Mindwtr's Self-Hosted URL to the base URL, for example `https://mindwtr.example.com`. Mindwtr appends `/v1/data` automatically.

Use `Caddyfile.local-https` for LAN-only hostnames with Caddy's internal CA:

```dotenv
MINDWTR_CLOUD_DOMAIN=mindwtr.home.arpa
MINDWTR_CLOUD_CORS_ORIGIN=https://mindwtr.home.arpa
MINDWTR_CADDYFILE=Caddyfile.local-https
```

Every device must trust Caddy's local root certificate before a client will accept this certificate. Public certificates are usually simpler for mobile clients.

After the LAN-only stack starts, export the local root certificate:

```bash
docker compose --env-file docker/.env.https.local -f docker/compose.https.yaml cp caddy:/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt ./mindwtr-caddy-root.crt
```

Install that certificate as a trusted root on each device that will sync to this hostname.

Minimal cloud service shape:

```yaml
services:
  mindwtr-cloud:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: docker/cloud/Dockerfile
    environment:
      MINDWTR_CLOUD_DATA_DIR: /data
      MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS: ${MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS}
      MINDWTR_CLOUD_CORS_ORIGIN: https://mindwtr.example.com
      MINDWTR_CLOUD_RATE_MAX: "120"
      MINDWTR_CLOUD_ATTACHMENT_RATE_MAX: "120"
    volumes:
      - ./mindwtr-cloud-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Operational notes:

- The repository Dockerfile uses a multi-stage runtime image and pins the Bun base image by digest for repeatable rebuilds.
- Mount `/data` on durable disk, not ephemeral container FS.
- Keep tokens in secrets manager or `.env` outside git.
- For Docker secrets, use `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS_FILE` instead of inlining the token in compose.
- The same deployed container serves both sync and REST API traffic on the same host/port.

## Reverse Proxy Checklist

At proxy layer:

- Enforce HTTPS.
- Limit request body size to match cloud limits.
- Forward `Authorization` header unchanged.
- Set request timeout high enough for large attachment uploads.
- Restrict access by IP/VPN if possible.

Example Caddyfile:

```caddyfile
mindwtr.example.com {
  reverse_proxy mindwtr-cloud:8787
}
```

For LAN-only internal certificates:

```caddyfile
mindwtr.home.arpa {
  tls internal
  reverse_proxy mindwtr-cloud:8787
}
```

Example nginx snippets:

```nginx
client_max_body_size 50m;
proxy_read_timeout 120s;
proxy_send_timeout 120s;
proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
```

## Backups and Restore

Data format is file-per-token JSON plus attachment files.

Backup:

1. Snapshot or archive `MINDWTR_CLOUD_DATA_DIR`.
2. Keep point-in-time backups (daily + weekly retention).
3. Verify restore periodically.

Restore:

1. Stop server.
2. Restore directory contents to `MINDWTR_CLOUD_DATA_DIR`.
3. Start server.
4. Check `GET /health` and run a client sync validation.

## Attachment Cleanup

When a user deletes an attachment, clients keep a `pendingRemoteDeletes` record until the backend delete succeeds. Those pending deletes are intentionally not aged out, because removing them before a successful remote delete can leave private files behind.

Mindwtr Cloud also provides authenticated orphan cleanup for attachment files that are no longer referenced by the current `data.json` snapshot:

```text
POST /v1/attachments/orphans
DELETE /v1/attachments/orphans
```

Run this after restore operations or as a periodic maintenance task if you want server-side cleanup of files that became unreachable outside the normal client delete flow. The endpoint scans the authenticated token namespace only and returns counts for scanned, kept, deleted, and failed file paths.

The cleanup skips attachment files modified in the last five minutes so an upload followed by a later `/v1/data` reference cannot be deleted by a concurrent maintenance run.

## Upgrade Procedure

Safe rolling procedure:

1. Take backup.
2. Deploy new version in staging or canary first.
3. Run smoke checks:
   - `GET /health`
   - authenticated `GET /v1/data`
   - authenticated `GET /v1/tasks`
   - authenticated `GET /v1/projects`, `GET /v1/areas`, and `GET /v1/sections`
   - small and large attachment upload/download
4. Deploy to production.
5. Monitor logs for `rate limit`, `invalid payload`, and `permission denied` errors.

## Token Rotation

Recommended rotation flow:

1. Add new token to `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS` alongside old token.
2. Update clients to new token.
3. Remove old token after migration window.

Because token hash maps namespace/file, changing token changes storage namespace. If you require continuity under a new token, migrate corresponding data file/attachment directory deliberately.

## Observability

The cloud server writes structured JSON logs to stdout/stderr.

Minimum log alerts:

- Repeated `Unauthorized`
- Frequent `Rate limit exceeded`
- `Cloud data directory is not writable`
- `Invalid remote sync payload`

Add host/container metrics:

- CPU and memory
- disk free space on data volume
- p95 request latency
- non-2xx response rate

Clock note:

- The server participates in merge and repair on `PUT /v1/data`, so host clock drift can still affect request logs and rate-limit windows. Keep NTP or equivalent time sync enabled.
- Merge repair timestamps use the server wall clock. This prevents a client clock that is a few minutes fast from poisoning server-generated repair metadata.

## Failure Modes

- Permission errors: volume ownership/permissions mismatch.
- CORS failures: wrong `MINDWTR_CLOUD_CORS_ORIGIN`.
- Token mismatch: client token not in allowlist.
- Large payload failures: body limits exceeded at proxy or app layer.
