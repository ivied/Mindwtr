# Cloud Sync (Self-Hosted)

> This standalone page is deprecated as a primary doc. Use the canonical pages below depending on what you are trying to do.

Mindwtr's self-hosted cloud backend is a small sync server under `apps/cloud`. It is a sync endpoint for desktop/mobile clients, not the Mindwtr app UI.

## Canonical Pages

- Use [[Data and Sync]] for choosing a sync backend and configuring the client.
- Use [[Cloud Deployment]] for server setup, operations, and environment variables.
- Use [[Docker Deployment]] if you want the Docker-based deployment path.

## Quick Orientation

- The self-hosted cloud backend stores one JSON namespace per bearer token.
- Clients point at the `/v1` base URL and sync through `GET/PUT /v1/data`.
- `/v1/data` is the canonical sync contract; task routes are optional convenience APIs and clients should not depend on matching project or area CRUD routes.
- Attachment APIs live under `/v1/attachments/...`.
- Deploy it behind HTTPS and treat the bearer token like a password.
- For normal device access, Mindwtr Cloud requires HTTPS. A local-network URL like `http://192.168.x.x` will not work in the mobile/desktop clients.
- `http://localhost` is only intended for local development. If you need plain HTTP on a private LAN, use WebDAV instead.
